The purpose of this project is to analyze predictions using various machine learning algorithms and to document the steps using a template. Working through machine learning problems from end-to-end requires a structured modeling approach. Working problems through a project template can also encourage us to think about the problem more critically, to challenge our assumptions, and to get proficient at all parts of a modeling project.
For this round of modeling, converting the credit limit and age attributes from ordinal to categorical did not have a noticeable effect on the accuracy of the models.
The project aims to touch on the following areas:
•	Document a predictive modeling problem end-to-end.
•	Explore data cleaning and transformation options.
•	Explore non-ensemble and ensemble algorithms for baseline model performance.
•	Explore algorithm tuning techniques for improving model performance.
